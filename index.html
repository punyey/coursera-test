                CHICKEN
            </div>
            <p>To make chicken, start by seasoning your preferred cut with salt, pepper, and any other spices you enjoy. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat, then add the chicken and cook until it's browned on both sides. Reduce the heat, cover the pan, and let the chicken cook through, about 15-20 minutes depending on the thickness. You can check if it's done by using a meat thermometer to ensure it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Once cooked, you can enjoy the chicken as is or use it in your favorite recipes.</p>

                BEEF
            </div>
            <p>Season your beef with salt, pepper, and any other desired spices. Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Sear the beef on all sides until well browned, then reduce the heat to medium.  For steaks, cook to your desired doneness using a meat thermometer (145°F for medium-rare, 160°F for medium, 170°F for well-done). For roasts, cook low and slow until tender. Let the beef rest for a few minutes before slicing against the grain.</p>

                SUSHI
            </div>
            <p>Making sushi starts with perfectly cooked and seasoned sushi rice.  While the rice cools, prepare your fillings, such as sliced fish, vegetables, or other ingredients.  Lay a sheet of nori seaweed on a bamboo mat, spread a thin layer of rice on top, and arrange your chosen fillings in the center.  Using the mat, carefully roll the nori and rice around the filling to form a tight cylinder. Finally, slice the roll into bite-sized pieces and serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and ginger.</p>
